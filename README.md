## 💼 Experience

**National Telecommunication Institute (NTI) - ETA Training Program (On-Site) - Location
(Egypt New Capital)**
- Mastered core concepts of AI and Machine Learning, including Supervised and Unsupervised Learning, Feature
Engineering, and Model Evaluation, as part of the HCIA-AI V4.0 curriculum. 
- Gained advanced practical skills in Deep Learning (CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, Transfer Learning), Computer Vision
(Object Detection, Image Processing), and using frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras to solve
real-world problems.

**Tips Hindawi- LLMs intership | Remote**
- Gained hands-on experience with Large Language Models (LLMs), including the use of Transformers, Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG), and Fine-tuning techniques.
- Developed and deployed LLM-powered applications using LangChain for orchestration, and utilized Streamlit and
ngrok to create and publicly expose interactive web interfaces.

**CodeAlpha – Machine Learning Intern**  
- Built a Credit Scoring Model to predict creditworthiness using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, with metrics such as Precision, Recall, and ROC-AUC.  
- Developed an Emotion Recognition System using deep learning (CNN, RNN, LSTM) and MFCC feature extraction on datasets like RAVDESS and TESS.  
- Implemented Handwritten Character Recognition with CNNs on MNIST/EMNIST datasets, extendable to word-level recognition.  
- Created Disease Prediction Models with SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost on structured medical datasets (diabetes, heart disease, breast cancer).  

**CodeAlpha – Python Programming Intern**  
- Designed a Hangman Game with randomized words and limited attempts.  
- Built a Stock Portfolio Tracker using dictionaries and file handling to calculate investments.  
- Automated repetitive tasks such as moving files, extracting emails, and scraping webpage titles.  
- Developed a Rule-Based Chatbot with predefined conversational replies.
